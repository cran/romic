\title{romic: R for High-Dimensional Molecular Data}
\description{
'romic' represents high-dimensional data as tables of features,
  samples and measurements, and a design list for tracking the meaning of
  individual variables. Using this format, filtering, normalization, and
  other transformations of a dataset can be carried out in a flexible
  manner. 'romic' takes advantage of these transformations to create
  interactive shiny apps for exploratory data analysis such as an
  interactive heatmap.
